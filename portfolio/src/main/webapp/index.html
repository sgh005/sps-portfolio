      <h1>This is Me!</h1>
      <p>I'm a 21 year old first gen student from LA going to UCSD
         I'm passionate about outreach and social justice. I'm currently the 
          outreach co-chair for Women in Computing and want to start a Latinx's in
          tech mini org. I love computer scinece and problem solving and I also 
          love/want to learn more about social activism and movements.
      </p>
      <p>My plans post graduation include going into industry and <i>ideally</i>
      working for a company that does community focused work </p>
        <p> In my free time I like to go down rabbit holes on random subjects,
            make Mexican food vegan, eating brunch from many of La Jolla's brunch
            spots, and watching movies and the LA Lakers
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to recommend readings on social justice and related topics!</p>
